Currently doing:
Implementation of polymorphic type.
Substantiation of structures is not working properly.
getKnownType function is suspect. To me, it should be returning a copy and
 not just the type itself.
Am trying out by implementing copy method in all Type sub-classes.

Another issue is that during lookup, the type parameters of inner structures
should be replaced with type variables as per the outer structure's type 
variables. See data/s29.txt for example.
